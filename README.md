# 📁 University Project Collection

This repository contains a curated collection of programming projects completed as part of university coursework. Each project focuses on different problem-solving paradigms and utilizes a variety of programming languages and techniques.

## 🔬 1. Birdsong Evolution Simulator

**Language:** Assembly (RISC-based)  
**Structure:** `Makefile`, `.s` source file, structured test cases

**Objective:**  
Simulates bird chirp patterns over time using an evolutionary model. Focuses on register-level manipulation and low-level logic in an environment with constrained memory.

## 📸 2. Instagram Simulation

**Language:** Java  
**Structure:** Monolithic `Main.java`, PDF report, structured test cases

**Objective:**  
Mimics an Instagram-like feed where users can post, follow/unfollow others, and view their dynamic feeds. It uses hash tables and max-heaps for efficient user and post management.

## 🧭 3. Magical Map

**Language:** Java  
**Structure:** Single-file implementation (`Main.java`), PDF report, zip-packed input/output test cases

**Objective:**  
Simulates a magical pathfinding map with fog-of-war, dynamic obstacles, and wizard interactions. Utilizes Dijkstra’s algorithm with real-time recalculations and decision-making for path optimization.

## 🧪 4. Witcher Tracker

**Language:** C and C++  
**Structure:** Dual implementation (`main.c` and `main.cpp`), one shared PDF report, structured test cases

**Objective:**  
Implements an object-oriented inventory and event tracker inspired by The Witcher universe. Supports command parsing, structured tracking of resources, and modular design across both C and C++ styles.

## 🛠️ How to Run and Test

- Ensure the corresponding `Main.java`, `.c` or `.cpp` file is compiled in an environment that supports standard Java or C/C++ compilation.
- Input and output files (such as `input.txt`, `output.txt`) must be placed in the **same directory** as the source file unless otherwise noted.
- For test automation, each folder includes a `test-cases.zip` archive with sample inputs and expected outputs.
- Use an appropriate IDE or terminal environment that supports standard input/output redirection.

> 💡 **Tip:** If you encounter build or runtime issues, consider using AI-based environments like GitHub Codespaces, Replit, or Visual Studio Code with relevant extensions to simplify setup.

## ⚠️ Final Notes

These projects were developed as part of university coursework and were designed to meet assignment specifications. As such, they **may not handle all edge cases or extreme input scenarios**, but they **fully satisfy the requirements defined within their respective course scopes**.
