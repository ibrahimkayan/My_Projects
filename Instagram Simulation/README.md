# Instagram Feed Simulation

This project simulates an **Instagram-like feed manager** written in Java. It supports user management, post creation, likes, follow/unfollow functionality, feed generation, sorting of posts, and interactive scrolling through feeds. The system leverages hash tables and max-heaps for efficient data handling.

## 📌 Features

- **User Management**: Create users, follow/unfollow others.
- **Post Management**: Create posts; track likes, views.
- **Feed Generation**: Generate personalized feeds based on followed users.
- **Scroll and Like**: Interactively scroll through the feed and like posts.
- **Post Sorting**: Sort a user's posts by like count.
- **Event Logging**: All user actions are processed via input commands.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.java` - The main source file that contains all class definitions and the main method.
- `Project_Report.pdf` - Project documentation describing implementation details and architecture.
- `test-cases/input.txt` - Sample command input to test the simulation.
- `test-cases/output.txt` - Corresponding expected output from the sample input.

## ▶️ How to Run

> Make sure you have **Java 8 or higher** installed.

## 1. Compile the program
Run the program directly in your IDE. Ensure that the input file, output file, my_output file, and main.java file are all located in the same directory. You can write a function to compare the expected output with the output produced by the program. Alternatively, you can manually compare them using a text editor or a file comparison tool.
