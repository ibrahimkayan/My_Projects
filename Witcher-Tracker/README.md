## Project Overview

Witcher Tracker is a command interpreter and inventory-event tracking system inspired by the world of *The Witcher*.  
This project simulates gameplay mechanics where the player manages Geraltâ€™s inventory, potion formulas, and monster encounters through text-based commands.  
The system parses input commands, updates internal state (ingredients, potions, trophies), and produces responses according to a strict grammar specification.

## Features

- Command parsing with grammar validation  
- Inventory management for ingredients, potions, and monster trophies  
- Brewing potions using learned recipes  
- Tracking monster weaknesses and encounters  
- Strict handling of invalid input commands  
- Modular design using C++ object-oriented programming principles

## Guide

There are both C and C++ implementations of the project, each with its own Makefile.  
Using these Makefiles, the code can be compiled and tested with the provided test cases.  
If any issues occur due to missing environments or container dependencies, please try compiling and running the code using standard compilation commands.
